"""
If astroid node

An if statement.

Attributes:
    - test    (Node)
        - Holds a single node such as Compare.
    - body    (List[Node])
        - A list of nodes that will execute if the condition passes.
    - orelse  (List[Node])
        - The else clause. Also, elif clauses donâ€™t have a special
          representation so it appears as If nodes within orelse.

Example:
    - test    -> Compare(Name(n), [(3,)])
    - body    -> [Pass()]
    - orelse  -> [If(n > 0, pass, n = 3)]
"""

if n == 0:
    pass
elif n > 0:
    pass
else:
    n = 3
